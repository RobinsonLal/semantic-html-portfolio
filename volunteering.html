        <li>Learning Towers (Amazon May 2024)</li>
        <p> <i>As a volunteer, I contributed to the "Learning Towers" initiative by painting Jenga blocks and inscribing educational questions on each block. These customized blocks were designed for use by children in government or NGO-run schools. The interactive nature of the game encourages children to learn while playing, as they answer questions written on the blocks, with correct answers provided by the teacher or facilitator. This initiative aimed to enhance the learning experience for underprivileged children by combining education with play.</i> </p>

This activity aligned with my commitment to environmental betterment by creatively repurposing materials that would otherwise go to waste.</i> </p>

            For every 6 kilometers or 7500 steps, we contribute, a school kit was donated to a child.

            Target was to reach out maximum females who are unable to manage their finances.
            So i reached out to my best possible limit and introduced them to important terms like Saving, Investing, Budgeting, and a lot more.

            So i reached out to the best of my limit and introduced them to important Acts, Policies, Laws regarding them which are present in our country.

            It was really a nice experience of volunteering under Red Dot Foundation.</i> </p>
